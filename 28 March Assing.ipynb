    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. The penalty term is based on the L2 norm of the coefficients and encourages smaller coefficients, which can lead to simpler models and reduce the sensitivity of the model to noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, OLS regression aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals directly without any penalty term. OLS regression can be prone to overfitting when the number of predictors is large or when there is multicollinearity in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is specifically designed to address the issue of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients towards zero. It is particularly useful when the number of predictors is larger than the number of observations or when the predictors are highly correlated."

    "- Linearity: The relationship between the predictors and the response variable should be linear. If the relationship is non-linear, then non-linear regression methods may be more appropriate.\n",

    "\n",

    "- Normality: The errors should be normally distributed. This assumption is important because if the errors are not normally distributed, then the estimates of the coefficients may be biased, and the hypothesis tests and confidence intervals may not be reliable.\n",

    "- No multicollinearity: The predictors should not be highly correlated with each other. This assumption is important because if the predictors are highly correlated, then the estimates of the coefficients may be unstable and difficult to interpret."

This effectively shrinks the coefficients of less important predictors towards zero, resulting in a model that only includes the most important predictors.\n",

As lambda increases, the magnitude of the coefficients decreases, and the less important predictors are eventually eliminated from the model when their coefficients are shrunk to zero.

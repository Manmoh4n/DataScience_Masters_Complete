    "Grid search CV (Cross-validation) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used in machine learning to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. The purpose of grid search CV is to exhaustively search through a predefined set of hyperparameters and evaluate each combination using cross-validation to determine the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps for performing grid search CV are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a set of hyperparameters to tune, along with their respective ranges or values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a performance metric to evaluate the model, such as accuracy, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each combination of hyperparameters in the defined range or set, train the model on the training set, evaluate its performance on the validation set using the defined performance metric, and record the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the combination of hyperparameters that gives the best performance on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the selected model on the test set to estimate its performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV performs an exhaustive search over all possible combinations of hyperparameters in the predefined range or set, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming for large datasets or complex models. To address this issue, more advanced techniques like randomized search CV and Bayesian optimization can be used to reduce the search space and accelerate the hyperparameter tuning process"

    "Grid search CV and randomized search CV are both hyperparameter tuning techniques used in machine learning to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. However, there are some differences between the two, as described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Search Method: Grid search CV performs an exhaustive search over a predefined set of hyperparameters, whereas randomized search CV randomly samples hyperparameters from a specified distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search Space: Grid search CV searches over a fixed set of hyperparameters, whereas randomized search CV can search over a broader space by randomly sampling hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation Time: Grid search CV can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets or models with many hyperparameters, as it performs an exhaustive search over all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Randomized search CV is typically faster than grid search CV because it randomly samples hyperparameters from a distribution, which reduces the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result Quality: Grid search CV can guarantee finding the optimal set of hyperparameters, given a large enough search space and enough computation time. Randomized search CV cannot guarantee finding the optimal set of hyperparameters, but it can often find a good set of hyperparameters in less computation time compared to grid search CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use each technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV: If the number of hyperparameters is relatively small and the computational resources are sufficient, grid search CV can be used to perform an exhaustive search over all possible combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal set. It is also a good choice when the hyperparameters have a clear and interpretable relationship with the model's performance metric.\n",

    "Randomized search CV: If the number of hyperparameters is large or the computational resources are limited, randomized search CV can be used to randomly sample hyperparameters from a distribution to search over a broader space in less computation time. It is also a good choice when the relationship between hyperparameters and performance is not clear or when there are many equivalent hyperparameter settings that perform well."

    "Data leakage in machine learning occurs when information from the validation or test set is used to train the model, leading to overly optimistic estimates of the model's performance. In other words, data leakage happens when the model has access to information that it would not have in a real-world scenario, leading to a biased model that performs poorly when deployed in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage can occur in many ways, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Leakage: When features that are closely related to the target variable are included in the training data, leading the model to learn patterns that may not generalize to new data.\n",

The dataset also contains information about the merchant's identity, such as their name and location. If the model is trained on the entire dataset, including the merchant's identity, it may learn to associate certain merchants with fraudulent transactions. This is an example of target leakage, as the merchant's identity is closely related to the target variable (whether the transaction was fraudulent or not). In this case, the model may perform well on the training data and the validation data, but it may perform poorly when deployed in the real world since the model will not have access to the merchant's identity in a real-world scenario."

    "\n",
    "Keep the Validation and Test Data Separate: Ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are kept separate throughout the entire modeling process. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during hyperparameter tuning, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. Information from the validation or test set should never be used to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cross-Validation: Cross-validation can help to prevent data leakage by dividing the training data into multiple folds and using each fold for training and validation. This ensures that the model does not overfit to a specific subset of the training data and that the validation set is not used in the model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be Careful with Feature Engineering: Feature engineering can introduce data leakage if features are created using information that would not be available in a real-world scenario. For example, creating a feature based on the target variable, such as the mean or median value of the target variable for each group, can introduce target leakage. Always be careful to create features based on information that would be available in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be Careful with Preprocessing: Preprocessing steps, such as scaling or imputing missing values, should be applied separately to the training, validation, and test sets. Information from the validation or test set should never be used to preprocess the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Time-Based Cross-Validation: If the dataset contains time series data, time-based cross-validation can be used to ensure that the model is evaluated on data from a future time period. This can help to prevent information leakage from the future to the past.\n",

    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both statistical models used for predicting a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. The key difference between them lies in the nature of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used when the dependent variable is continuous, and the goal is to predict its value based on the values of the independent variables. The model assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, which means that the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable is constant across its entire range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical, i.e., it takes on discrete values such as 0 or 1. The model is used to predict the probability of an event occurring based on the values of the independent variables. In other words, it estimates the likelihood of a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, true/false) based on the input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of when logistic regression would be more appropriate is predicting whether a person is likely to default on a loan. The dependent variable in this case is categorical, i.e., whether the person will default or not. The independent variables could be things like the person's credit score, income, employment status, etc. The logistic regression model would then estimate the probability of default based on the values of these variables.\n",

    "Gradient descent works by iteratively adjusting the model's parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the cost function.

    "Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization performance on new data. One common cause of overfitting is when the model has too many features relative to the number of training examples, which can lead to over-emphasis on noisy or irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization helps address this issue by adding a penalty term to the cost function that encourages the model to use a simpler set of weights, which in turn can help prevent overfitting. There are two main types of regularization used in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (Lasso regularization): In L1 regularization, the penalty term is proportional to the absolute value of the weights, which encourages the model to select a smaller set of features by setting the weights of irrelevant features to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (Ridge regularization): In L2 regularization, the penalty term is proportional to the square of the weights, which encourages the model to spread the importance of features more evenly by reducing the magnitude of all weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of regularization help prevent overfitting by shrinking the magnitude of the weights, which reduces the model's ability to over-emphasize the influence of any one feature. The strength of the regularization can be controlled by a hyperparameter, typically denoted as lambda, that determines the relative importance of the penalty term compared to the original cost function.\n",

However, these methods can lead to overfitting or underfitting, respectively, and may discard useful information.\n",

    "- Entropy: The decision tree algorithm aims to maximize the information gain at each split, which is based on the concept of entropy. Entropy measures the impurity or randomness of a set of examples. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "H(S) = -Σ p_i log2(p_i)\n",
    "\n",
    "where S is the set of examples, p_i is the proportion of examples in S that belong to class i, and log2 is the logarithm with base 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all examples in S belong to the same class, then entropy is 0. If S is equally divided among two classes, then entropy is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information gain: The information gain of a split is the difference between the entropy of the parent node and the weighted average of the child nodes' entropies. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "IG(S, A) = H(S) - Σ (|S_v| / |S|) * H(S_v)\n",
    "\n",
    "where A is the attribute being tested for the split, S_v is the subset of examples that have a value v for the attribute A, |S_v| is the number of examples in S_v, and |S| is the total number of examples in S.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information gain measures how much the entropy decreases after splitting the examples based on the attribute A. The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen for the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gini index: Another measure of impurity or randomness is the Gini index, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini(S) = 1 - Σ (p_i)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini index measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen example from S. If S is pure, then the Gini index is 0. If S is equally divided among two classes, then the Gini index is 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting criteria: The decision tree algorithm uses either information gain or Gini index as the splitting criterion. The attribute with the highest information gain or lowest Gini index is chosen for the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursive partitioning: The decision tree algorithm recursively partitions the feature space into smaller subsets based on the chosen splitting criteria. The process stops when a stopping criterion is met, such as maximum depth of the tree or minimum number of examples per leaf node.\n",
    "\n",

The goal of the algorithm is to find a partition that separates the examples in different classes as well as possible.\n",

    "To visualize this geometric intuition, imagine a 2D feature space with two features, x and y. The decision tree algorithm would create a partition of this space by recursively splitting it into rectangles along the x and y axes. Each rectangle corresponds to a leaf node of the tree, and the class label assigned to that node is the majority class of examples that fall within the rectangle.\n",

    "Simple Linear Regression involves a single independent variable and a single dependent variable, where the goal is to find the best-fit line that represents the linear relationship between them. For example, we could use Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between a student's study hours and their exam score. Here, the study hours would be the independent variable, and the exam score would be the dependent variable.\n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. The cost function is a measure of how well the model fits the training data and is typically represented as the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The goal of gradient descent is to find the values of the model's parameters (e.g., coefficients in linear regression) that result in the lowest possible cost.\n",

    "The concept of gradient descent is based on the idea that we can move towards the minimum of a function by taking small steps in the direction of the steepest descent. In other words, we follow the negative gradient of the function with respect to the model parameters. The size of the step we take is called the learning rate and determines how quickly we converge to the minimum. If the learning rate is too large, we may overshoot the minimum and fail to converge. If the learning rate is too small, we may converge too slowly or get stuck in local minima.\n",

During training, the model's parameters are updated iteratively using the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.

One common way is to calculate the correlation matrix of the independent variables and look for high correlations between pairs of variables. Another approach is to use the variance inflation factor (VIF) which measures the degree of multicollinearity between each independent variable and all other independent variables in the model. A high VIF value suggests that multicollinearity may be present.\n",

    "To address the issue of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression, there are several techniques that can be used. One approach is to remove one of the highly correlated independent variables from the model. Another approach is to use regularization methods such as ridge regression, lasso regression, or elastic net regression, which introduce a penalty term to the regression coefficients and shrink the coefficients towards zero, thereby reducing the impact of multicollinearity. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) can also be used to reduce the dimensionality of the independent variables and remove multicollinearity."
